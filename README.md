# [Your Project Name]

## Overview
[Your Project Name] is a microcontroller-based project that monitors and displays environmental data using an OLED screen. It features a DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor, battery level monitoring, and an RTC for timekeeping. The display alternates between temperature, humidity, and battery status every 7 seconds for easy readability.

## Features
- **Temperature and Humidity Display**: Readings from a DHT22 sensor are displayed in real-time.
- **Battery Monitoring**: Shows battery voltage as a percentage based on a user-defined range.
- **OLED Display**: 128x64 OLED screen for clear and dynamic data presentation.
- **RTC Integration**: Keeps accurate time using an RTC module, even across power cycles.
- **Non-blocking Code**: Uses `millis()` timing to ensure smooth, continuous operation.

## Getting Started

### Hardware Requirements
- **DHT22 Sensor**: For temperature and humidity readings.
- **OLED Display (128x64)**: SSD1306 compatible.
- **RTC Module**: DS3231 for timekeeping.
- **Battery**: Battery pack and necessary voltage regulation.

### Installation
1. **Connect the Hardware**:
   - DHT22 to pin A1
   - OLED display via I2C at address `0x3C`
   - Battery to pin A7

2. **Upload the Code**:
   - Open the `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
   - Select the appropriate board and port.
   - Upload the code to your microcontroller.

3. **Run the Program**:
   - Upon startup, the OLED screen will display "Bonjour!" for 3 seconds.
   - It will then begin alternating between temperature, humidity, and battery status every 7 seconds.

### Code Structure

- **setup()**: Initializes the display, DHT22 sensor, and RTC.
- **loop()**: Reads sensor data and updates the display based on timing intervals.
- **Functions**:
  - `readTemperatureAndHumidity()`: Reads and stores temperature and humidity.
  - `readBattery()`: Calculates battery percentage.
  - `showTemperature()`, `showHumidity()`, `showBattery()`: Display functions for each data type.

### Configuration

- **Display Interval**: Change the `displayInterval` variable in `loop()` to adjust how often the display changes.
- **Battery Voltage Range**: Modify `maxVoltage` and `minVoltage` in `readBattery()` to reflect your batteryâ€™s range.

## Troubleshooting
- **Screen Sticking**: If the screen stops updating, check wiring and sensor connections.
- **Sensor Failures**: Ensure the DHT22 sensor is not affected by environmental factors like high humidity or dust.
